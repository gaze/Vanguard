building
-----------

The only tool required for a kernel binary is the GNU
toolchain. For making a floppy image, mtools and grub
are required.

To build, in the main directory just type make.  A floppy
image will be built

Note, this will not work under the OS X toolchain.
The GNU linker is required.
